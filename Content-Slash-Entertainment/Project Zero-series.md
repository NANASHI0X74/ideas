# TV Series - Project Zero

## what the show is about
- it's about an Movie Director who is struggling with Career fatigue
- it's also about the Movie Project Zero (insert link to .md file)
- (it's partly inspired by the Netflix Series BoJack Horseman)

### it covers themes including:
    - career fatigue
    - existential dread/ nihilism
    - drug (ab)use
        - integrated as part of a creative workflow
    - a creator hating his own creation and dissonance between the perception of a creation by it's creator and other people
    - depression
    - burnout (maybe)

## characters
- (just one at this time)

### the director (guy)
- very egotistical
- 30-something
- has supervised several highly successful productions, - successful in terms of critical and
economic success and public <love, acceptance, trying to find the right word here, they were instant classics, masterpieces>
    - -> has accrued a lot of fame and reputation and in turn a lot of creative freedom
- struggling with career fatigue
    - frustrated about his workflows becoming...
        - more and more routine, and in the course also mundane, in a away
        - and at the same time not efficient enough to satisfy his desire to create / his expected productive output
-struggles to find meaning in his life
- uses drugs...
    - to facilitate both divergent and convergent thinking
        - marijuana
        - Adderall, Ritalin
        - caffeine, coke
        - psychedelics
    - for escapist/ self-destructive purposes
        - (all of the above :p)
        - alcohol
        - cigarettes (nicotine)
        - coke
        - Heroine (?)
- his general frustration and desperation inspires hate...
    - toward himself
    - toward the people who work with him, though he also respects them very much for the work they're doing and for putting up with him.
    - toward fans
    - and to a lesser extent toward in general people he deals with
    - also, definitely his Career...
    - ...and the current project he's working on...
        - ...although at the same time he's deeply invested in the ideas he's trying to communicate
        - -> which makes him feel obligated to make the project as good as theoretically could be humanly possible
- the idea for the movie was purposefully chosen by him to be extremely scandalous, during a very dark time <in terms of his mood>, hoping to erode the trust that many people put in him by producing a movie unlike his previous work (more details about the themes of the movie in its own .md file (insert link when started) )
    - he still  gets attached to these themes and wants to perform well in communicating them and make a good Movie
- he loses his motivation more and more
    - -> we often see him slacking off
        - listening to loud music in a room for longer times
        - watching stuff
    - he starts sleeping less
