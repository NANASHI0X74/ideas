# TV Series - In a van down in Kongo

## what the show is  about

- It's about two dudes who founded their own PMC /PSC
- It's set in a country where the control of different territories is under constant conflict, authority may change weekly among a handful of militias
- ^A Country like the 'Democratic Rebublic of Kongo', which, last time I checked, was very broken and also conflict-ridden due to mining of the rare ore Coltan
- They specialize in 'Tactical Recon' or something like that, mainly supporting larger PMC forces in protecting territories **or** they provide a service where they manage security and hire Merc forces as needed
- They live in a teched-out van in which they travel around/ which they deposit in strategic positions (it's probably heavily armored or something too)



## Characters

### the two main characters who chose to found the company
1. to put it simply because they were bored
2. to put it in more accurate terms...
    * they came to an understanding that life and their lives in particular had no meaning, which led them to adopt a nihilistic/ hedonistic world view
    * In their perspective, they found an opportunity to do something exciting and lucrative

### Guy 1 who sits in the van all the time
- **highly** intelligent, like 2 sigma > avg (IQ of about 160)
- basically built the van and their comm infrastructure
- linked to the other guy via radio, over which they also transmit a video feed and whatnot
- remotely supports the other guy in the field
- about 27 yo

### Guy 2 who operates in the field most of the time
- about 27 yo
- uses  a cool vector semi-automatic

### Guy 3 who they work with as their supplier or something
- (exists mainly because I think a third main character would make for better char dynamics, but haven't thought about him much)
- they trust him a lot, but don't have that much to do with him


## additional ideas
- the outro Credits to the show use a different song every episode, which (tangentially) fits the theme of the episode
    - (probably going to insert some links here when I'm working online)
- the intro also uses  a song, maybe turbowolf - cheap magic
- twist at the end of the series - Guy 2 has died long ago in combat and the whole series was a retelling of the events from Guy 1's perspective
    - -> to his therapist
    - -> last episode is also about his last therapy session
    - -> very end: guy walks away from therapist's office, roll credits -> Song plays, maybe The Offspring - Bad Habit
- a later series set in the same universe, but 10 years later revisits the character briefly - he's a software developer now
     - -> he gets very emotional about a failed project (cries), and some guy tries to comfort him
     - -> he thanks him and says he'll be ok, then opens up to him...
     - -> ... and tells him about how he trained himself to be very emotional about his work, with both pleasant and unpleasant emotions...
     - -> ... because he wasn't motivated enough to do any work otherwise
