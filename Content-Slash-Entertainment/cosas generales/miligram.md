# Movie? just a narrative element, really - MiliGram

## what is it about?
- there's a company which developed advanced bio/nanoelectronic weapons which can neutralize anyone in a few seconds/ a minute
- (optionally non-lethal neutralization)
- they use this to keep order (peace?)

## Variations
- locality
  - the company operates worldwide
  - the company operates only in a country
  - the company operates in a union of states
    - of western states
    - of arabic states
    - of asian states
    - of developing countries
- origin
  - they were funded in the same location/culture they operate in
  - the founders/ the personnel comes from another culture
- extent of centralization of power
  - there's an elite/representative government which has exclusive power over these technologies
  - power is decentralized
    - e.g. a person can order another person to be incapacitated temporarily in response to physical violence (or something like that)

## central conflict/ plot of the story

#### there are lots of possibilities here:
- there's a conflict between the culture of origin of miligram and the culture it operates in
- we have a character with an individual conflict and we just explore the consequences/ social impact of this technology, sort of like in Black Mirror :D
