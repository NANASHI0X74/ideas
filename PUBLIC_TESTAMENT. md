### 1. my body

- 2. is not to be stripped for parts to be used by other dying living organisms
- 3. is to be taken apart for the purpose of research, and understanding my body and it's composition
    - furthermore, if it is possible at the point of my death or shortly thereafter to analyze *the* abstract brain, or my brain in particular, my brain and mind is to be analyzed for purposes regarding the understanding of connections between the human brain, the human body and the human mind. 
    - if it is necessary to preserve the rest of the body for the above stated purpose
