# ideas
A repository where I collect/write down ideas bouncing around in my head
(tried gists and don't want to use them for this/ think a repository is more appropriate for the purpose)

## why I created this repo
- (stub :p)

## how to use
- every site in here <for the more "tech-savvy", every .md file>
- everything is in english <and that isn't going to change>
- (stub)
- (insert meme- instructions unclear, dick stuck in toaster)

## Safety precautions
- Â¡lots of uncensored thoughts here, don't expect political correctness!
