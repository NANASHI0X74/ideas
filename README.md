# ideas
A repository where I collect/write down ideas bouncing around in my head
(tried gists and don't want to use them for this/ think a repository is more appropriate for the purpose)

## why I created this repo
- (stub :p)

## how to use
- every site in here <for the more "tech-savvy", every .md file>
- everything is in english <and that isn't going to change>
- if you have feedback, write it in a github issue. If you don't know how to do that, ask google or a technically versed person <you will need a github account>
    - if you know how to contact me, you may try asking me how to do the above
- (stub)
- (insert meme- instructions unclear, dick stuck in toaster)

## Safety precautions
- ¡lots of uncensored thoughts here, don't expect political correctness!
- ¡¡warning! may contain disruptive thoughts. !
- I may or may not update the repository in the future. (likely will)
