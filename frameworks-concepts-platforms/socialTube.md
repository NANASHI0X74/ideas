# socialTube (working title) - a decentralized streaming platform and social network for sharing creative content

#### inspired by #Artikel13 and other developments

## what it's about
- a decentralized platform
  - everything isn't hosted on a central server, but on instances
  - you can host an instance of it yourself
- for streaming/publishing and sharing creative content e.g.
  - Videos
  - Music
  - interactive Experiences (?)
- it has recommendation algorithms
  - which promote smaller creators
  - and which are social in nature
  - and ideally diverse and granular, i.e you can switch between feeds e.g. for
    - popular creators/content
    - content/creators your friends are following
    - content that is recommended to you based on the content you like
- it is offered as a packaged service, i.e.
  - you can create an account on a centralized website, which will be created on a random instance (you can also choose/ host your own website)

## nice-to-have features
- an own ad network
  - which promotes other creators on the platform
  - which might bring in some money
    - to cover server costs
    - and reward/pay creators
  - this network is also decentralized and open source (?)
- comment/share/recommending functionalitites which are also decentralized
  - e.g. based on SoLiD pods
- subscription/recommendation/ social feeds are also offered via atom/rss and granular/ customizable
