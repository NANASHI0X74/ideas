- pre: after a particularly long night of science <haha ( https://gaf.fs.lmu.de/langenacht )> this evolved into a sort of log-file of random thoughts

Original purpose stuff

# Quoteable one-liners
- I shall not stand idly by where misinformation and fear are nourished
    - ,for ignorance is the root of all that is evil
- Communication is a necessary tedium
- I h8 communicating b/c 2 less efficient
    - tl/dr: fuk off
- extracerebral Communication...
    - (is too inefficient... +stuff)
- programmers are better surgeons and vice-versa
- was the time right for star wars before or after it came out?
- Much rather be surprised than do something known to be enjoyable to  you


Stupid thought-logfile stuff

# Jokes I don't want to be quoted on
- this tool is made from submarine steel - it disappears and emerges again (ok, in this _exceptional_ case  the german version: Dieses Werkzeug ist aus U-bootstahl - es taucht ab und irgendwann wieder auf)

## jokes I really, really don't want to be quoted on
- everything organic is perishable

### jokes that only work when you're very very tired / drunk / high / all of the above / whatever <or different term - jokes that only work when you're brain is broken>
- What's green and flies over Poland? Peter Panski ( (_ah, goddammit..._) Was ist grün und fliegt über Polen? Peter Panski)
- Dr B. Gee - presumably very good at staying alive
- you see - the laughing is a sign of your brain running out of oxygen
    - "our life expectancy is probably like ~10 mins now" - "alright, but we can still laugh during that time"

- everything needs googly eyes
### ...that only work when you're a TUM student
- #exzellenz

#### "the best joke of all time" <not to be confused with "the best joke you've ever heard - from really far away"

- Penis
