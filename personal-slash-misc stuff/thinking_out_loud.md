### Game Design considerations
- how about, when you fail a few times at the same time checkpoint , you get the choice to turn on easy mode until you reach the next one (without repercussions for achievemenys/trophies e.g. it's irrelevent on which difficulty you play the game for trophies or you can later redo the checkpoint in normal mode)
