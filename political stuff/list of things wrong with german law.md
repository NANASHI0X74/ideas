# A list of stupid stuff in german laws that should be corrected asap
- companies pay VAT when donating stuff (to charities or other entities)
    - That's a problem because: if any material is not suitable for selling, it's a lot more expensive to donate it than to just destroy it. So companies are disincentivzed from donating.
    - according to: §3.3 Abs. 10 UStAE (http://vereinsknowhow.de/kurzinfos/ust-spenden.htm)
- alg 2 - bedarfsgemeinschaften (communities of need) include children under 25
    - That's a problem because: if children of alg 2 receivers earn more than 100€, they get to keep only 20% of the income because the rest is subtracted from the alg 2 payment. This in effect perpetuates poverty across generations.
    - actually after I've looked into it a bit more, I understamd alg 2 is altogether an atrocity. It's just that I heard about this specific problem sooner, from this youtube video: <https://youtu.be/YilbojIzt04>
    - according to: SGB 2 §7 Abs 3 4. (https://www.gegen-hartz.de/bedarfsgemeinschaft-alg-ii)
