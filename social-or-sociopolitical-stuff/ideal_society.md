# Principles of an ideal Society

## Things that I think a stable human society should do/have/fulfill.
### -Disclaimer: I don't have a background in sociology or similar. Everything I "know" stems from School Education, my own observations and a small amount of Videos e.g. by CGP Grey

### the ideal society is hereinafter referred to as "we" or "us" :p

## General principles

- ### Principle of Preferred Reversibility

  - ### Meaning:
    - irreversible action = i.e. the state before the action was taken cannot be reached without extremely high expenditures/ e.g. effort that exceeds the effort the action took times ~ 1.5
    - We should try not to take irreversible actions like changing the face of the earth
    - We will not enter a commitment for which there is no provided way to exit again (i.e. either treaties that can be terminated or commitments with a clearly defined fulfillable purpose which will terminate after said purpose is achieved)

  - ### Constitutional laws:
    - We declare it a crime to coerce someone to irreversibly commit to anything
    - We declare irreversible commitments illegal


- ### Principle of Flexibility and Modularity

  - ## Meaning:
    - The Constitution/ fabric of us is easily changeable
    - We can easily break us apart and spawn multiple societies with different laws, but which automatically form treaties agreeing on the laws which didn't  change (these (multiple, granular) treaties can of course be terminated according to the principle of Preferred Reversibility)

  - ## Constitutional laws:
    - anyone (part of us  or not part of us) may start a discussion and process to change, add or remove Constitutional or other laws
    - a proposed change to our laws may only be implemented after a consensus among people in us has been reached
    - the details of the processes of finding consensus are clearly defined beforehand in our laws, but may be chosen initially by us and need not be defined in the constitution
    - a society may seperate into multiple new societies when changing any law
    - said new societies automatically enter treaties agreeing on laws that didn't change
    - said treaties automatically terminate when the corresponding laws change or can voluntarily be terminated at any time even if the corresponding laws didn't change

  - ## Motivation:
    - the Observation that most of today's societies aren't flexible enough to support their diverse, fluctuating and evolving people
    - (actually I believe people are inherently diverse btw)

- ### Principle of Enabling

  - ## Meaning:
    - We do what we can to 
- ### Principle of Choice
- ### Principle of Decentralization
- ### Principle of Privacy
- ### Principle of proportionate accountability
